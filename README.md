## About
Finished around March 2023, this was the first implemenation of the allocation wizard and many other useful features. This project uses Vue 2, and heavily relies on the Vuetify 2 components collection. Soon after this final commit, work on v3 was started in an effort to better structure the project's code using Vue 3's Composition API, while continuing to take advantage of Vuetify's collection of components in Vuetify 3.
